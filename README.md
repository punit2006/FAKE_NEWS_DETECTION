Perfect 👌 You’ll need a **README.md** that explains your project clearly — what it does, how it works, and what’s next.
Here’s a structured draft for your Fake News Detection + AI News Agent project:

# 📰 Fake News Detection & AI News Agent

## 📌 Overview

This project started as a **Fake News Detection System** and is now evolving into a **Real-Time AI News Agent**.
The system combines **traditional machine learning, deep learning, and transformer models (BERT, extendable to GPT)** to classify news articles as **real or fake**, with plans to expand into a self-updating, query-answering news assistant.

---

## 🚀 Features

### ✅ Fake News Detection System

* **Baseline Model**: TF-IDF + Logistic Regression
* **Deep Learning Models**: CNN, LSTM, Hybrid CNN-LSTM
* **Transformer Model**: DistilBERT (with option to extend to GPT)
* **Interactive Testing**: Classify custom input with confidence scores
* **Stable Training**: 10-epoch runs for reproducible performance

### 🔮 Upcoming AI News Agent (Work in Progress)

* 🌍 **Retrieve live global news** daily
* 📚 **Expand dataset continuously**
* 🧠 **Train dynamically using BERT/GPT**
* ❓ **Answer user queries** about current events
* 🛡️ **Detect misinformation in real-time**

---

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

* **Languages**: Python
* **Libraries**:

  * `scikit-learn` → TF-IDF, Logistic Regression
  * `TensorFlow / Keras` → CNN, LSTM, Hybrid Models
  * `transformers (Hugging Face)` → DistilBERT / GPT models
  * `pandas`, `numpy` → Data processing
  * `matplotlib`, `seaborn` → Visualization

## ▶️ Usage

### 1️⃣ Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2️⃣ Run the system

```bash
python fake_news_detection.py
```

### 3️⃣ Choose a model

* Logistic Regression
* CNN
* LSTM
* Hybrid CNN-LSTM
* Transformer (DistilBERT / GPT)

### 4️⃣ Test with custom input

Example:

```
Enter news text: "Government announces new AI policy..."
Prediction: REAL (Confidence: 92%)
```

## 📊 Dataset

* Primary: [Fake News Dataset (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/c/fake-news/data)
* Future: Live feeds from **news APIs** (Mediastack, Chronicling America, etc.)

---

## 🔮 Roadmap

* [x] Build baseline + deep learning models
* [x] Add transformer support (BERT)
* [ ] Extend to GPT-based classification
* [ ] Integrate real-time news fetching
* [ ] Enable daily dataset updates
* [ ] Build a Q/A interface for live queries

Do you want me to also prepare a **`requirements.txt`** file (with exact dependencies) so your README and code are fully ready to share on GitHub?
